Troll-SAS-Mine
==============

Data Mining program written in SAS for Studying Head-end network data. 

These routines will look at product repair data, Network Protocol Terminal data, 
System outage data and Technical support case data and use statistical techniques
to characterize the health of the headend site and create a partial (to the best of
its ability) network map.
